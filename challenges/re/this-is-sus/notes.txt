The idea is to use a combination of before main, during main to set up the key and environment.

A segfault handler is registered where it invoke the real main logic function when the program segfaults.

Sprinkle some junk asm that will trigger segfault in main function and use the handler to invoke real main. This indirect call should not be captured by decompiler.

Throw in stripped static binary for good measures.
